      <description>For the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been cross stitching as a way to relax. I like how I can follow a pattern someone else created, listen to some music, and eventually end up with a beautiful piece of art to display. Below are a few of the pieces that I’ve made. Patterns are from DMC, as well as this book.&#xA;However, I’ve found my hand gets tired after holding the hoop for a long period of time.</description>

      <description>Today, thorough the Winnipeg Fringe Festival’s “NextGen Fringers” program, I had the opportunity to see two shows. The first one, and the subject of this post, was 1000 pieces of π. This interpretive dance piece includes only 10 moves, corresponding to each digit from 0-9. For each digit, the corresponding move is preformed.&#xA;My first reaction upon hearing this premise was “there’s no way they can make this interesting”. However, by adding in props, and keeping a rotation of dancers entering and exiting the scene, they managed to keep the 50-minute runtime interesting.</description>

      <description>Hello!&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to set up a blog for a while, to give me a nice, and convenient, way to chronicle all my different experiences. I originally tried making my own site from scratch using NeoCities to host it, as I’m a big fan of the old web aesthetics. Unfortunately, I quickly hit a wall with my HTML/CSS abilities, and although I learned a lot building it, getting my site to a presentable level would have taken dozens of hours that I simply don’t have.</description>
