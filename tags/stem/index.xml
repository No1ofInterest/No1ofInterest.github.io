      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made a number of laser cutting projects while at Northforge, and not all of them are large enough to fill a full article.&#xA;My first project was to create a finger-jointed box to store some of my sewing and cross stitch supplied in. It was fun modelling the parts in Fusion, as I got to take advantage of the Mirror and Slice tools to speed up my workflow and ensure everything fit together correctly.</description>

      <description>I have seen many laser cut maps for sale at farmers markets and gift stores, but given that I have access to a laser cutter though Northforge, I decided to make my own. The main guide I followed was this one , but it uses Adobe Illustrator, which I do not have a licence for.&#xA;I adapted the process to work using CorelDraw, which is the vector drawing software Northforge has, and also is the software set up to export to the laser cutting machines in the facility.</description>

      <description>For the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been cross stitching as a way to relax. I like how I can follow a pattern someone else created, listen to some music, and eventually end up with a beautiful piece of art to display. Below are a few of the pieces that I’ve made. Patterns are from DMC, as well as this book.&#xA;However, I’ve found my hand gets tired after holding the hoop for a long period of time.</description>

      <description>Hello!&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to set up a blog for a while, to give me a nice, and convenient, way to chronicle all my different experiences. I originally tried making my own site from scratch using NeoCities to host it, as I’m a big fan of the old web aesthetics. Unfortunately, I quickly hit a wall with my HTML/CSS abilities, and although I learned a lot building it, getting my site to a presentable level would have taken dozens of hours that I simply don’t have.</description>
